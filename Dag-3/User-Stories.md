1. Gameplay-first player (mechanics nerd)
As a player, I want to be able to master responsive casting, reeling, and fish behavior systems so that I can have a fun time perfecting my skill and feeling rewarded for getting better.
Personally wants: tight controls, skill-based mini-games, different fish that actually fight differently.

2. Content-driven player (collector / completionist)
As a player, I want to be able to discover many fish species, locations, rods, and upgrades so that I can have a fun time collecting everything and feeling like there’s always something new to unlock.
Personally wants: a fish journal, rare/legendary fish, hidden locations, 100% completion goals.

3. Cozy / relaxation player
As a player, I want to be able to fish at my own pace in calm environments with relaxing music and visuals so that I can have a fun time unwinding and playing without pressure.
Personally wants: day/night cycles, weather, ambient sounds, no harsh timers or failure states.

4. Immersion-focused player (world & atmosphere)
As a player, I want to be able to explore believable lakes, oceans, and towns with environmental storytelling so that I can have a fun time feeling immersed in the world, not just the fishing.
Personally wants: NPCs with small stories, lore about fish, changing scenery, secrets in the environment.

5. Systems & progression lover
As a player, I want to be able to upgrade gear, specialize my playstyle, and make meaningful choices so that I can have a fun time building a setup that feels uniquely mine.
Personally wants: skill trees, rod perks, bait synergies, multiple viable playstyles (speed fishing vs big game).

6. Reviewer / critic perspective
As a reviewer, I want to be able to experience polished mechanics, clear progression, and a strong visual identity so that I can give this game a good review and recommend it to a wide audience.
Personally wants: smooth onboarding, intuitive UI, strong first hour, a clear hook that separates it from other fishing games.
