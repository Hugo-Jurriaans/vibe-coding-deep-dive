For user stories

Can you make 6 different use-stories for my game? use the format: As a (player or reviewer) I want to be able to do (function / content / qualities) so that I can (Have a fun time / give this game a good review). these different stories can have different priorities some people like gameplay over content and vice versa. and add in some stuff they personally would like to see in my fishing game.

For Design Doc
lets plan on how we are going to make this fishing game, I would like to do it as a Website game, so we have to use HTML / CSS / Javascript, what risks could that give us? what kind of styling should we use? and what kind of choices should we make in the process of building this game?
